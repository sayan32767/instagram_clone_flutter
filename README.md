# Insta 📸

This project is a clone (with some added goodness) of Instagram built using Flutter and Firebase. It replicates the core features of Instagram, such as user authentication, image sharing, adding comments, liking posts, and following other users.

## Features

- **🔑 User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles using Firebase Authentication.
- **🖼️ Image Upload:** Users can upload and share photos with others, using Firebase Storage for image hosting.
- **💬 Likes & Comments:** Users can like posts and leave comments, with real-time updates.
- **🫂 Follow/Unfollow:** Users can follow or unfollow other users, similar to the original Instagram functionality.
- **🔎 Searching Users:** Users can Search for other users, and see all their posts directly.
- **📋 Edit Profile:** Users can edit their profile anytime they want.
- **✨ Generative AI:** Users can generate images from prompt (USING META AI), and directly post it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK:** Install the latest version of Flutter from the [official website](https://flutter.dev).
- **Firebase Account:** Set up a Firebase project and enable Authentication, Firestore, and Storage.

### Environment Configuration

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Include the necessary environment variables (needed for Generative AI features)
   - Example `.env` file:
     ```dotenv
     BASE_URL=your_base_url
     ```

2. **Firebase Configuration Files:**
   - **Android:**
     - Download the `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project settings and place it in the `android/app` directory.
   - **iOS:**
     - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from your Firebase project settings and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory.
     - If applicable, download the `firebase_app_id_file.json` file for iOS and place it in the `ios/` directory.
   - **Dart Configuration:**
     - Generate the `firebase_options.dart` file using the `flutterfire configure` command or by following the official [Firebase Flutter documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview).

3. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
